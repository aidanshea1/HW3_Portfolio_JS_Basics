  <h1>Analyzing Data Distribution and Computing the Number of Distinct Elements in a Data Set Consisting of Over One Million Data Points</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		Implemented algorithms to find the exact F0 and F2 norms of a data set in order to compute the number of distinct elements and analyze the distribution of the dataset respectively
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Implemented the BJKST and Tug of War algorithms to estimate the number of distinct elements and the F2 norm of the data set respectively and compared the estimates with the actual values
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Leveraged Spark and Google Cloud Platform to parallelize running the above algorithms and compared the run time to running the algorithms locally
  	</li>
