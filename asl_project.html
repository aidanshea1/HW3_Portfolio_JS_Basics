  <h1>ASL Fingerspelling Detection and Translation using a Convolutional Neural Network</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		Preprocessed 164,500 images using horizontal shifting, vertical shifting, and zooming to a random extent to create more noise within our dataset to help prevent overfitting and then used a k-means approach to hand segmentation
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Tested numerous neural network architectures consisting of varying amounts of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Experimented with batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization techniques in order to help prevent overfitting and
		improve our generalization rate
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Achieved a 97.43% accuracy rate on the testing portion of the dataset which was not used for model training and validation
  	</li>
  </ul>
